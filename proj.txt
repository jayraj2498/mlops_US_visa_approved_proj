To create the flowcahrt we use website : 

1. first we setup template.py we setup all file structures skeleton which is required for project 

2. what are the package we are using inside the project we will mention inside the requirement.txt  file 
    with the hel of -e we able to install particular packages also we able install us_visa as a package 

3. create python environment  conda create -n visa python=3.11 -y  
    - conda activate visa 

4 . - Data base setup : mongodb atlas 
        here we have mongodb atlas database we setup it to store data 
        visa data --> make connectin in mongodb 
        data ingestion -- > in that it will go to db and fetch connection through database  
        - before doing modular coding we do notebook experiment 

        mongodb -- > we create project 
        after creating project we create cluster 
        creted cluster0 set its name & pass jayraj2498 and also add public ip addres --> allow access from anywhere 
        in term of connecting to cluster0 select the driver option --> select python and select version 3.6 or later 
        also copy your connection string --> 
        mongodb+srv://jayraj2498:jayraj2498@cluster0.a78lv.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

        first -> we create database --> inside we create collection 
        see mongodb.ipynb file . 



    - logging module 
        - whenever we productionize the code in cloud , if error is encountered so you can download that log file and take action
        - we create the custom logger 
    - exception module (own exception) 
    - utility module
